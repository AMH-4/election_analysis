## Elections-Audit Summary:
One of the greatest advantage this script can offer the election commission is time saved and human error elimination. The elimination of human error is a great advantage as bias potential bias or voter count fraud can be elimated and ensure a reliable voter count for democracy. This script can be modified to be be used for other elections as the election commission sees fit. While this code is able to quickly run for a data set with 369,711 rows, further modification would be needed to support larger voter turnouts at the state and national levels.
